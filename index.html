        <h1>The Green Sandles</h1>
        <p>
            Where are they gone the Green Sandles?<br>
            I was not made to be a mother,<br>
            I had too stricken a heart<br>
            So I wore green sandles to stay apart.<br><br>
            Then one night,<br>
            A man stood in an olive grove.<br>
            He beat viper till it bled<br>
            then drew me down low.<br>
            One night was all there was.<br>
            He fed me an olive leaf<br>
            and broke the strap off my dress.<br><br>
            I kept on the green sandles<br>
            but could not get off that hill.<br>
            Italy, where did you take me that night?<br>
            so dark and still.<br>
            He had an accent and a knife<br>
            and somewhere even had a wife.<br>
            He took my face and tore my hips<br>
            and planted in thier place something<br>
            new & strange, and near to love<br><br>
            I thought, I had nothing left<br>
            but you came later,<br>
            curved anew.<br><br>
            Forgive me.<br><br>
            I did not have means for catching<br>
            when I got poor Lucy.<br><br>
